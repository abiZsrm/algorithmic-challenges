/**
 * Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle
 * (i.e any node that the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle)
 * of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE 
 * Input: The node c from the linked list 
 *         a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f
 * Result: Nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like 
 *         a -> b -> d -> e -> f.
