/**
 * Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that
 * all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x
 * is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the
 * elements less than x (see below). The partition element x could appear
 * anywhere in the right partition; it does not need to appear between the left
 * and right partitions.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE 
 * Input: 3-> 5-> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [Partition = 5] 
 * Output: 3-> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
