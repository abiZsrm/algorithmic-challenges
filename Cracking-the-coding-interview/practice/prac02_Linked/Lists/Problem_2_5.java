/**
 * Sum Lists: You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node
 * contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that
 * the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two
 * numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE 
 * Input: (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That is 617 + 295 
 * Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9 that is, 912.
 * 
 * FOLLOW UP: Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. 
 * 
 * EXAMPLE Input: (6 -> 1-> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5). That is 617 + 295.
 * Output: 9 -> 1 -> 2. That is 912.
