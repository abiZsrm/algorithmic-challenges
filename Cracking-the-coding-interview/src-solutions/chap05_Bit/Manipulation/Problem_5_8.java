/**
 * Draw Line: A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing
 * eight consecutive pixels to be sorted in one byte. The screen has width w,
 * where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The
 * height of the screen, of course, could be derived from the length of the
 * array and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from
 * (x1, y) to (x2, y).
 * 
 * The method signature should look something like. 
 * drawLine(byte[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y).
